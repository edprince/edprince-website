My personal website

##Areas on which to focus
1. Music
2. Computing

###Music
This section should have links to all of my music online, plus some guides.

###Computing
The majority of my computing work is stored on GitHub already, and so the site only needs to contain links to projects or just to my main GitHub page. There may also be some guides on here as well.

###Resources
